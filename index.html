                <h2>Plot</h2>
                <p><strong>Jessica "Jess" Day (Zooey Deschanel)</strong> is a bubbly and quirky teacher in her late 20s who comes home to find her boyfriend,
                     Spencer, with another woman and leaves him immediately to look for somewhere else to live. 
                     After answering an ad for a new roommate on Craigslist, she finds herself moving into a loft in Los Angeles with three
                      men around her own age: <strong>Nick, Schmidt, and Coach</strong>. After the pilot episode, <strong>Winston</strong>, a former roommate and Nick's
                       childhood friend, replaces Coach, who had vacated the apartment to live with his girlfriend.
                    <strong>Cece</strong>, Jess' childhood best friend and a successful fashion model, frequently visits Jess and the guys.
                </p>
                <p>The series follows the group's amusing interactions with each other as they become closer friends,
                     and their romantic relationships. Midway through season 1, Schmidt and Cece get involved in a mostly sexual relationship
                      but break up at the end of the season. In Season 2, Jess is laid off from her teaching job; she and the others get involved
                       in mostly temporary relationships, although Cece enters an arranged marriage engagement with Shivrang (Satya Bhabha) that
                        is broken up at their wedding in the season 2 finale. The season 2 finale features Taylor Swift, Shivrang's love interest
                         when he and Cece do not go through with their wedding. Cece realizes that she loves Schmidt because of how selfless he is.
                          Jess and Nick become romantically attracted to each other, making their relationship official at the end of season 2, and
                           it lasts through most of season 3. Coach returns to the loft in season 3 after revealing that he had broken up with his
                            girlfriend and stays through season 4 where he moves out to be with another girl, May (Meaghan Rath). After bouncing around
                             several random jobs, Winston works to become a police officer with the LAPD, and falls in love with his partner <strong>Aly 
                             (Nasim Pedrad)</strong>. At the end of season 4, Schmidt proposes to Cece, and they marry at the end of season 5. In season 5, 
                             while Jess is on jury duty, the group brings in temporary roommate <strong>Reagan Lucas (Megan Fox)</strong>, whom Nick becomes interested in.
                              Reagan becomes Nick's love interest but they break up at the end of season 6. Season 7 advances the storyline three years
                               later where Schmidt and Cece have a three-year-old daughter named Ruth, Winston and Aly are expecting their first baby,
                                and Nick proposes to Jess.

                <h2>Production</h2>
                <h3>Conception</h3>
                <img src="./images/winston_and_schmidt.jpg" alt="Winston and Schmidt flashback" class="center">
                <p>20th Century Fox Television first approached playwright Elizabeth Meriwether in 2008 to develop a pilot that was
                     eventually shelved. After Meriwether's success with the 2011 romantic comedy film No Strings Attached, 
                     20th Century Fox approached her once more, and she pitched an idea for a TV sitcom about an "offbeat girl
                      moving in with three single guys", inspired by her experience of "bouncing from Craigslist sublet to Craigslist
                       sublet, for four years in L.A." when she was in her twenties. This show was initially called Chicks and Dicks,
                        and two of the characters were already similar to the final characters of Jess and Schmidt. The initial idea
                         was a Will & Grace-style comedy inspired by Meriwether's close friendship with a guy after their exes started
                          dating each other. The FOX network liked the script and pursued Zooey Deschanel for the role of Jess,
                           to whose story Meriwether felt most connected. As the script developed, the plot moved on from being about
                            the sexual endeavors of the roommates and became more socially oriented, so the title was changed to New Girl.
                </p>
                <h3>Casting</h3>
                <img src="./images/jess_schmidt.jpg" alt="Jess and Schmidt pose together" class="center">
                <p>Movie actress and singer-songwriter Zooey Deschanel was in the process of developing an HBO show when she read the
                     New Girl pilot script and responded to the material. The character of Jess was not specifically written
                      for Deschanel, but the producers found it a great match and needed little fine-tuning.
                       With the support from Fox, Meriwether wanted to make Jess a unique, interesting and funny female character
                        that would have been the side character on other shows. Deschanel became a producer on the show and helped build
                         the character, requesting to not play the classic wife character who would be ignored by the guys she tries
                          to keep out of trouble. Meriwether's goal was to write about herself from an honest perspective,
                           with Jess mirroring her at the start and later Deschanel until Jess turned into a "hybrid of me and Zooey,
                            the writers, and the editor". Deschanel described Jess as a part of her, especially with regard to "the sort
                             of enthusiasm and optimism" of her youth. She does not shy away from playing embarrassing scenes or being
                              unattractive. As Kasdan said, "This show advocates for the attractive dork." Although Meriwether had
                               always imagined the show as an ensemble show, Fox would later focus its first marketing push on Zooey
                                Deschanel and gave the show the promotional tagline "Simply Adorkable."
